# Funky Monkey

A small passion project made by me with the help of others to showcase my (pretty crumby) learning of Discord.JS and using GitHub!

## Disclaimer

This project solely exists as a showcase of what I have done in Discord.JS and GitHub. The code in this repo isn't great and isn't meant to be great. You can fork or host it if you like but I'm not promising it'll be anything worth using ðŸ˜‚

## Hosting

<sup>The above button also contains my referral code. This helps support me at no additional cost to you!</sup>

Add an environment variable named `token` and set the value to your [Discord bots token](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#setting-up-a-bot-application).

## Credits

Bot made by RooRay with help from Ashish (aka Trains), testing help also from some other friends and other people.
